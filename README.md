# RevengeChess
Chess variant where captured pieces respawn when their captor is captured. Inspired by the Basketball variant [Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#Knockout).

Please excuse my messy code. This is another one of those projects where I worked on it in two distinct bursts, years apart from each other.
